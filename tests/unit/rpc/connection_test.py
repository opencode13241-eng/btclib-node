"""What rpc.connection.RpcConnection does with the octets off a socket.

Driven over a socketpair rather than through a running node: the
functional tests already put a real HTTP client in front of a real
server, and what they cannot reach from there is the half of this file
that only a malformed request provokes -- a header section that never
ends, a Content-Length no client would send, a body that is not JSON.

    """send_and_wait gives up after its own timeout, not blocking forever.

    It is what the `stop` RPC uses: the answer has to reach the client
    before the node goes down, but a client that never reads it must not
    keep the node up. The loop here is never run, so the coroutine never
    completes and the wait is the whole of what is exercised -- which
    costs the two seconds the timeout is set to.

    `send_and_wait` hands that coroutine to the loop through
    `run_coroutine_threadsafe`, which only turns it into a `Task` once
    the loop's own thread runs the callback that does so -- never, since
    this loop's `run_forever` is never called. The coroutine object then
    sits unreferenced except by that queued callback, and Python warns
    when it is collected unawaited: a real defect ordinarily, and
    exactly the state this test asks for on purpose.

    `future.result(timeout=2)` waits on a `threading.Condition`, whose
    `wait` reaches `_thread.lock.acquire(True, 2)` -- CPython's
    `lock_PyThread_acquire_lock` (`Modules/_threadmodule.c:814-833`, at
    python/cpython@v3.14.0) calls `_PyMutex_LockTimed`
    (`Python/lock.c:53`), whose own deadline reads `PyTime_MonotonicRaw`
    (`lock.c:67,148`) -- on Windows `QueryPerformanceCounter`
    (`Python/pytime.c:1065-1090`), the same clock `time.monotonic()`
    itself reads (`PyTime_Monotonic`, `pytime.c:1223-1225`, through the
    same `py_get_monotonic_clock`), so the lock's deadline and this
    test's own `waited` measurement are not two different clocks. The
    wait itself parks through `_PyParkingLot_Park` into
    `_PySemaphore_PlatformWait`, which on Windows calls
    `WaitForMultipleObjects` with a millisecond count taken from
    `_PyTime_AsMilliseconds(timeout, _PyTime_ROUND_TIMEOUT)`
    (`Python/parking_lot.c:95-133`, the call at `:130`, the conversion
    at `:105`) -- not `WaitForSingleObject`, and not the legacy
    `Python/thread_nt.h` path `_thread.Lock` no longer uses in 3.14.
    What remains is the gap between that millisecond count and the
    clock the OS actually satisfies the wait against: the kernel's own
    interrupt-time tick, which `_WINDOWS_TIMER_TICK`'s own comment
    above cites Microsoft's documentation for. A 2000ms wait is
    satisfied once that tick clock reaches "start tick + 2000ms", up to
    one tick before 2000ms have elapsed on the QPC-backed clock
    `time.monotonic()` reads, so `_WINDOWS_TIMER_TICK` is the slack
    this bound needs -- small next to the two-second wait it guards, so
    a regression that actually shortens the wait still fails loudly.
