"""`RpcConnection`, one accepted HTTP socket carrying one or more requests.

Parses the header section off the wire, bounded by `MAX_HEADER_BYTES`
and `MAX_BODY_BYTES` since both are read before any credential is
checked, answers a request line, a request-target, a header field or
a `Content-Length` Core's listener cannot frame, and a chunked body it
cannot read, with 400 or 413 (`_HeadReader`, `_ChunkedReader`), answers
an `Expect` it does not meet with 417 and `100-continue` with an interim
`100 Continue`, answers `manager.interrupted` with 503 once
`RpcManager.interrupt` has set it (issue #1515), answers a source
`-rpcallowip` does not name with a bare 403, refuses a method or a path
Core's listener refuses before Core checks a credential (`_refusal`),
answers a request whose `Authorization` header `rpc.auth.RpcAuth` does
not accept with 401, and decodes the body of one it does accept, which
`rpc.manager.RpcManager.messages` queues for `rpc.main.handle_rpc`.
`RawJSON` is a JSON number written back out exactly as given, the way
Core's own `UniValue` writes one built from a string rather than from a
`float`.

Each answer is framed as libevent frames it (`_frame`), in the version
of the request it answers, and the socket is kept open across answers
where libevent keeps it, the next request read off the same connection
rather than requiring a fresh accept per call (issue #640).

The framing is the libevent `bitcoind` v31.1.0 links, not Core's own
source: bitcoin/bitcoin@9be056a8a7, the v31.1 tag, hands the socket to
`evhttp`, and `depends/packages/libevent.mk` there pins
2.1.12-stable, read at libevent/libevent@5df3037 (`http.c`).

class RawJSON:
    """A JSON number written to the wire exactly as given, not from a `float`.

    Core's own `UniValue(UniValue::VNUM, "<string>")` does the same:
    the value is built from a string and written out verbatim, whatever
    that string was, rather than round-tripped through a floating-point
    type on the way out. `ValueFromAmount` (`src/core_io.cpp:283-293`,
    at bitcoin/bitcoin@58a7869f86) is the caller this exists for --
    `rpc.callbacks.get_mempool_info`'s own `mempoolminfee`, an exact
    eight-decimal BTC amount a Python `float` cannot always carry:
    `repr` fixes no decimal places and emits exponent notation
    (`1e-06`) at a magnitude ordinary for a feerate, which Core's own
    `%d.%08d` format never does.

    `json.JSONEncoder.default` cannot return this directly -- its
    return value is re-encoded through the same machinery rather than
    written as-is, and Python's `json` has no hook for a raw literal.
    `JSONEncoder.default` below returns a marked placeholder instead,
    and `RpcConnection.async_send` substitutes it, quotes and all, for
    `text` once encoding has already run.

    The mark is not a fixed word: a fixed one is not actually safe -- a
    plain string value that happens to contain it once, unpaired (an
    error message echoing back a client's own malformed method name,
    say), lets a regex substitution's own non-greedy match run past
    that string's closing quote and merge it with an unrelated
    placeholder later in the same response, corrupting both.
    `RpcConnection.async_send` passes a fresh random token instead, one

    realistic risk the way colliding with a guessable word is.
